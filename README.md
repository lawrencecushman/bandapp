bandapp 
=======

This is a simple web app that allows you to manage some bands. 
I made it for my SE Webtech course, which incidentally focused about 90% on XML.
To maintain my sanity I decided to learn some Javascript and Python along the way.


###Bandapp is built on: 

- Python with the [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) templating framework
- XML as the database 
- [lxml](http://lxml.de/) to parse the XML
- [JQuery](http://jquery.com/) for all the fancy transitions
- [Bootstrap 2.3.2](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/) because Web 2.0
