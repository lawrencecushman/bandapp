bandapp - a simple band/music website
=======

This is a simple web app that allows you to manage some bands. 
I made it for my webtech course, which incidentally focused about 99% on XML.
To maintain my sanity I decided to learn some Javascript and Python along the way.


##Bandapp is built on: 

- Python with the [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) templating framework
- XML as the database 
- [lxml](http://lxml.de/) to parse the XML
- [JQuery]() for all teh fanct transitions
